<h3>Miscellaneous research</h3>

I've participated in TCS Stack Exchange (<a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/69837/alsips-cl">my account</a>) and in the OEIS (<a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/69837/alsips-cl">link</a>).

<h3>Teaching</h3>

<p>I've taught five semesters at PUC Chile: Data Structures (once) and Workshop on Competitive Programming (four times).</p>

<h3>Competitive Programming</h3>

<p>I was coach of the Competitive Programming Team at PUC Chile (2019-2024). One of our teams qualified for the ICPC World Finals twice ðŸŽ‰</p>

<p>I'm part of the ProgCompCL organization and have organized and taught at open winter camps for competitive programming in Chile.</p>

<p>I'm an active competitor in online events, particularly CodeForces. My username is <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/martins">martins</a>.</p>

<h3>Music</h3>

<p>I've been keyboardist, composer and arranger in some short-lived bands since 2009. The last one was called Vendimia; we released an EP in 2020 (<a href=https://open.spotify.com/intl-es/album/1EUC89KsC1ssiE0hmXMqvK>Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABUBAGBo6GU">YouTube</a>).</p>
